[The Steam Refund Checker](https://box.boodle.ai/a/@SteamRefundChecker)

This is the Steam Refund Checker, a relatively simple, yet professional chatbot that uses a relatively small knowledge base to determine if a Steam user is elligible for a refund or not. While Steam's refund policies are clear and concise, a chatbot like this would help users walk through their specific case step by step to check it against the conditions for a refund. The bot itself was built on ChatGPT 4o using Boodlebot, and information from Steam's store and support pages.
