# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**
<br />
**TO:** Mr. Matthew Bromberg, Chief Executive Officer and President, Unity Software
<br />
**FROM:** Dylan Starr
<br />
**SUBJECT:** Recommendations for Unity's User Manual
<br />
**DATE:** February 14, 2025
<br /><br />
This is an internal evaluation of the Unity User Manual, available [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html).
<br /><br />
This manual is successful in conveying the information it intends to. Broadly, it is thorough, and covers every available component, element, and asset type usable in-engine. Additionally, legacy and Long-Term Support versions of Unity are still available, making it useful to developers even in older environments. Sorting the manual into categories and subcategories, and allowing for the entire document to be searched makes it easy for developers to find what they need quickly, as does the presence of a direct link to the scripting API documentation at the top of the page. Unity 6 Beta in particular stands out as a more refined, yet similarly categorized version of the document familiar to returning developers and new users alike. Directing the manual's version switch function as to which pages exist in each version of Unity is particularly helpful in pointing out new features or different processes that have changed through updates.
<br /><br />
Although the manual contains the vast majority of the information necessary to understand Unity's functionality, it lacks momentum in navigation: For example, attempting to switch to the Scripting API from the main Manual for more detailed technical notes on components or parameters does not open related links, and instead requires users to navigate back to the content they were viewing under different categories. Additionally, older versions contain outdated screenshots that are not accurately reflective of the content one would see in-engine. Newer versions (specifically, the Unity 6 Beta manual) have mostly fixed this issue, but Long-Term Support versions of the engine require more accommodating documentation.
<br /><br />
To improve the manual, I recommend the following modifications:
<br /><br />
- Ensure parity in all engine screenshots; some displayed are from much older versions, and some are on different platforms (PC/Mac)
- Add a 'Related Pages' section to the Scripting API page switch if no exact page match exists in the Manual, and vice versa.
- Refine and develop the Troubleshooting page further, remove tips that are outdated in new versions, and direct users to the Unity Forums.
- Reformat the Next and Previous Page buttons at the bottom of each page; long titles are cut off when viewed on some devices.
- Remove or re-label links that lead outside of the manual and to the Unity website if they dead-end or re-direct on older LTS versions.
- Add version switching to the Glossary.
