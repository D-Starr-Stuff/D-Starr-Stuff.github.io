# Wayback Analysis
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100401082612/http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.com, April 2010.</a> <br />
# Layout
Although Widescreen formats like 16:9 and 16:10 were available to consumers, 4:3 remained the standard aspect ratio until roughly 2012 to 2013. The webpage's margins, when viewed on a modern display, are quite large, and account for around half of the screen real estate. While present-day web design would likely decrease this significant margin size, it is likely vertical banner ads would be placed along the borders as well, something which YouTube relegated to a main, horizontal banner ad at the top of the page.
# Content
At this time, YouTube still maintained and readily linked their official blog posts next to videos, encouraging individuals to create accounts and upload content. They also boast the ability to upload videos in 1080p HD quality, and that 24 hours of content are uploaded every minute, which when <a href="https://blog.youtube/press/">compared to current metrics, serves to show how much their userbase has increased.</a>

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
